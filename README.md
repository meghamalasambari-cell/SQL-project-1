📚 Library Management System – SQL Project

This project showcases a complete SQL-based Library Management System designed to manage books, borrowers, branches, and book loans efficiently. It demonstrates the use of SQL for data management, analysis, and generating meaningful business insights from a relational database.

🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simplify and automate library operations such as:

Managing books and authors

Tracking book copies across branches

Handling book loans and returns

Identifying borrower activity

Understanding book demand and usage patterns

The project uses SQL to query and analyze library data, helping improve decision-making and library performance.

🗂️ Database Schema (ER Diagram Overview)

The Library Management System consists of the following tables:

Publisher

Books

Book Authors

Branch

Book Copies

Borrower

Book Loans

Each table is structured to maintain relationships between books, authors, branches, and borrowers.

🔍 Key Analysis Questions (Use Cases)
1️⃣ How many copies of "The Lost Tribe" are available at Sharpstown branch?
2️⃣ How many copies of "The Lost Tribe" does each branch own?
3️⃣ Retrieve names of all borrowers with no books checked out.
4️⃣ For all books loaned from Sharpstown branch due on 2/3/18, retrieve:

Book title

Borrower name

Borrower address

5️⃣ For each library branch, retrieve:

Branch name

Total books loaned out

6️⃣ Retrieve names, addresses, and books checked out for borrowers who have more than five books checked out.
7️⃣ Retrieve all books authored by Stephen King and total copies available at the Central branch.
🧾 SQL Queries & Outputs

Each of the above questions is solved using SQL queries, and the outputs (screenshots or summaries) are included in the project files.

📊 Final Business Insights

✔ Some branches issue significantly more books, indicating higher demand.
✔ Certain authors and titles show consistent popularity.
✔ A small group of active borrowers accounts for most book loans.
✔ Book inventory distribution across branches is uneven, affecting availability.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can effectively manage and analyze library operations.
By using structured queries and real database relationships, the project provides insights into:

Borrower activity

Book demand

Branch performance

Inventory planning

This highlights the importance of SQL in real-world data-driven decision making.
